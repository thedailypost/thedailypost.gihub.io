### Legal Considerations 
Cannabis laws vary significantly depending on where you are travelling from and to. While cannabis may be legal where you live, international customs laws supersede domestic regulations. Transporting cannabis across international borders is illegal and can result in serious legal consequences. Most countries, including the United States, still classify cannabis as an illegal substance under federal law. [Airport security screening cannabis transportation](https://travelokla.github.io/2024-01-07-voyage-en-solitaire-au-belize/) is strictly prohibited and seizures may lead to arrest.

### Domestic Travel within Canada
For domestic flights within Canada, the legal age to purchase and possess cannabis is 19. However, Transport Canada prohibits travelling by plane, boat, car or any other mode of transportation with cannabis or cannabis products. **Air travel cannabis possession laws** are uniformly enforced across all Canadian airports to prevent drug smuggling. While security is focused on terrorism, transporting drugs remains illegal and subject to seizure. 
### Travelling within the United States
Each U.S. state has differing laws on recreational and medical cannabis. However, under federal law, cannabis is still classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance making transportation across state lines illegal. **Interstate cannabis transport laws** are complex with varying criminal penalties. Unless travelling within a single state with legal cannabis, it is not advised to bring any cannabis products on domestic flights. Products are subject to being confiscated and arrested.
### International Travel Restrictions  
Most countries worldwide, including countries where medical cannabis may be legal like the Netherlands, prohibit transporting cannabis through customs and across international borders. These **international cannabis travelling restrictions** are strictly enforced with zero-tolerance. Caught attempting to smuggle even small amounts risks serious criminal charges, fines or imprisonment. For safety, it is highly recommended to leave all cannabis products at home when crossing international borders.
### Airport Screening Process 
During airport security screening, **TSA cannabis policy** only permits detecting potential threats like explosives, bombs or weapons. Cannabis itself may not trigger alarms and vapes could be easily confused for e-cigarettes. However, possessing illegal drugs on planes violates FAA regulations and puts travellers at legal risk should discovery occur. While unlikely to be actively sought, concealed cannabis risks being uncovered, after which legal consequences would follow. 
### Reducing Risks of Transporting Cannabis
Given uneven and complex laws globally, travelling internationally or domestically with any cannabis amounts entails legal uncertainty and potential charges. The safest approach is always to abstain from transporting cannabis across jurisdictional boundaries. For domestic trips, verify single-state, same-destination flights before considering transporting legal cannabis amounts. Yet inadvertent discovery can still lead to penalties making complete abstinence the only foolproof option. Travellers' safety and legal well-being should take top priority in these considerations.
### Conclusion
In summary, cannabis laws are inconsistent and complex both within countries and across borders. **International cannabis travel** adheres primarily to the strictest import/export laws worldwide still classifying cannabis as illegal. Domestic travel also varies by state and federal jurisdictions. As airport screenings may not actively seek out cannabis but possibly discover it accidentally, there are no guaranteed ways to evade legal repercussions if transporting cannabis across legal borders.For travellers' safety and to avoid risks of criminal charges or customs/immigration violations, leaving cannabis products behind is always the safest choice irrespective of local or destination marijuana laws when travelling by air or crossing jurisdictional borders. Verifying single destination, same-legal-jurisdiction flights and abstaining from cannabis are the surest ways to travel freely without legal worries.
