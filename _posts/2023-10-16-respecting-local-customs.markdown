[Buddhist stupa attire etiquette](https://codeoffers.github.io/tabs/categories/) must be followed by removing shoes and wearing modest clothes at pagoda sites. Myanmar is overwhelmingly Buddhist, so being sensitive to these customs is important. ***Rickshaw scams in Yangon*** can be avoided by only taking licensed taxis and using Grab. Prices on many goods and services are often not clearly posted, so always ask **"How much is this?"** in Burmese to avoid overpaying.
### Navigating Cities Safely
Pickpockets are common in markets, so keep valuables safe and secure. In **Yangon, beware of taxi scams** unless taking licensed taxis or Grab. Money exchange shops may try tricks, so carefully **count money exchanged** and don't go to dubious locations. Stray dogs are everywhere but harmless - just give them space as they sleep on sidewalks. Always ask locals for directions, as they are eager to help tourists.

### Exploring Iconic Sites   
The magnificent **Shwedagon Pagoda** is Yangon's most important religious site. In Mandalay, visit **Amarapura and Inwa ruins** for glimpses of ancient royal capitals. The spectacular plain of **Bagan** has over 2,000 stupas, best explored by bicycle or hot air balloon at sunrise/sunset. The surreal **floating gardens of Inle Lake** offer a unique way of life on tranquil waters.
### Experiencing Rural Myanmar
Escape major cities to connect with Myanmar's diversity and natural beauty. Inle Lake's **local crafts, markets and wineries** offer cultural insights away from crowds. The **Hukaung Valley Tiger Reserveâ€™s** endangered wildlife protection, though imperfect, show government efforts for conservation. Remote areas provide a view of daily life for Myanmar's predominantly **poor rural populations**.
### Healthcare and Emergency Preparedness     
**Hospitals in Myanmar lack resources**, so purchase travel insurance and be prepared to go to Bangkok for major health issues. Natural disasters like cyclones are common. Though the government was slow to acknowledge past events, local communities have experience coping and could likely offer shelter during emergencies.  
### Considering the Political Context
While reforms encourage tourism, the military still tightly controls many aspects of society. U.S. citizens face restrictions. Travelers should educate themselves on the ongoing **political repression and human rights issues** to have empathy for Myanmar's people within this complex context. Though a developing nation, its welcoming culture makes a visit a fascinating glimpse into a changing part of the world.
### Respect, Education and Local Empowerment 
When visiting anywhere, **cultural sensitivity and respect for local people** should be top priorities. Consuming local businesses, learning Burmese phrases and following etiquette helps empower communities and gives a positive experience for all. Educating oneself on a place's realities, both its beauty and challenges, allows travelers to experience new cultures with care, openness and understanding.
